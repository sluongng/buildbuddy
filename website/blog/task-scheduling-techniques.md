## Introduction

In the world of distributed systems, efficient task scheduling is paramount. It's the invisible engine that ensures resources are utilized effectively, jobs are completed in a timely manner, and the overall system remains responsive and stable. Without intelligent scheduling, even the most powerful distributed systems can become bogged down, leading to performance bottlenecks and frustrated users.

This blog post will delve into some interesting techniques and challenges encountered in building a robust task scheduling system, drawing insights from the approaches used within BuildBuddy's own infrastructure. We'll explore how BuildBuddy tackles the complexities of distributing and managing tasks across a fleet of executors, aiming to provide both high throughput and low latency for our users' builds and tests.

## Priority-Based Grouped Task Queueing

One of the core scheduling mechanisms BuildBuddy employs is a **Priority-Based Grouped Task Queueing** system. This approach allows for fair resource allocation across different users or organizations while ensuring that high-priority tasks are processed promptly within each group.

At a high level, incoming tasks are first categorized into groups. This grouping is typically based on the authenticated user or organization ID associated with the task. Each group then maintains its own `taskQueue`. When the `PriorityTaskScheduler` needs to select the next task for execution, it doesn't just pick the highest priority task globally. Instead, it iterates through the groups in a round-robin fashion.

For each group, the scheduler selects the highest-priority task from that group's `taskQueue`. This ensures that even if one group has a very large number of low-priority tasks, it doesn't monopolize the execution resources. Other groups will still get their turn, and their high-priority tasks will be processed.

Within each group's `taskQueue`, tasks are ordered by priority. This means that when a group gets its turn in the round-robin selection, its most critical tasks are considered first.

The benefits of this system are twofold:

1.  **Fairness Across Groups:** The round-robin selection among groups guarantees that every group gets a fair share of processing time. This prevents a single user or organization with a high volume of tasks from starving out others.
2.  **Prevents Starvation within Groups:** By prioritizing tasks within each group, we ensure that important tasks for a specific user/organization are not indefinitely delayed by a flood of their own lower-priority tasks. The `PriorityTaskScheduler` ensures that even if a group's queue is long, the critical work gets done sooner.

This combination of inter-group round-robin and intra-group priority scheduling provides a balanced and responsive task execution environment, crucial for a multi-tenant system like BuildBuddy.

## Resource-Aware Scheduling and Dynamic Task Sizing

Beyond just prioritizing and grouping tasks, effective scheduling must also be keenly aware of the resources available on each executor and the resources required by each task. BuildBuddy's `PriorityTaskScheduler` incorporates sophisticated **Resource-Aware Scheduling**.

Executors in the BuildBuddy fleet report their available resources, which can include standard metrics like CPU cores and RAM, as well as custom-defined resources specific to particular execution environments (e.g., availability of specific hardware like GPUs, or software licenses). When a task is scheduled, its resource requirements are checked against the available capacity of potential executors. The scheduler's `canFitTask` logic is a critical part of this, ensuring that an executor has enough free resources to accommodate a task before it's assigned.

This prevents overloading executors, which could lead to task failures or significant performance degradation for all tasks running on that machine.

Furthermore, BuildBuddy is exploring **Dynamic Task Sizing** to enhance resource utilization. Instead of relying solely on user-specified resource requests, which can sometimes be inaccurate or overly conservative, the system can learn from past executions. By measuring the actual resource consumption of similar tasks over time, or by employing predictive models, the scheduler can dynamically adjust the resource requests for new tasks. This allows for more efficient "packing" of tasks onto executors, maximizing throughput without compromising stability. For example, if a certain type of compilation task consistently uses less memory than requested, future instances of that task might be allocated a slightly smaller memory footprint, freeing up resources for other tasks.

## Ensuring Reliability: Task Leasing and Reconnection

In a distributed system, ensuring that each task is processed reliably and exactly once is a significant challenge. Network glitches, executor restarts, or scheduler hiccups can all potentially lead to tasks being dropped or, conversely, executed multiple times. BuildBuddy addresses this through a robust **Task Leasing and Reconnection** mechanism, managed by the `TaskLeaser` component.

When an executor is assigned a task, it doesn't just claim it outright; it acquires a **lease** for that task. This lease is a short-term claim, signifying that the executor has accepted responsibility for the task and is actively working on it. The purpose of the lease is to ensure that only one executor believes it owns the task at any given time, preventing redundant work and potential conflicts.

Executors are responsible for periodically renewing their task leases. If an executor fails to renew a lease (perhaps because it has crashed or become disconnected), the lease will eventually expire. Once expired, the `TaskLeaser` can safely make the task available for rescheduling on another healthy executor.

A key feature contributing to fault tolerance is **lease reconnection**. If an executor temporarily disconnects from the network and then reconnects, the `TaskLeaser` allows it to attempt to reclaim the leases for tasks it was previously working on, provided those leases haven't already expired and been reassigned. This prevents unnecessary re-computation if an executor experiences a transient network issue but quickly recovers, allowing it to continue its work seamlessly.

The `TaskLeaser` is central to this process, handling lease grants, renewals, expirations, and the reconnection logic. This system is vital for maintaining high availability and ensuring that user tasks are completed reliably even in the face of inevitable distributed system uncertainties.

## Intelligent Task Placement: Affinity and CI Runner Routing

Choosing *which* available executor to run a task on can significantly impact performance. BuildBuddy's `TaskRouter` component employs several strategies for intelligent task placement, including **Affinity Routing** and specialized **CI Runner Routing**.

**Affinity Routing** is based on the principle of "data locality" or "cache warmth." If a particular executor has recently run tasks similar to the current task (e.g., for the same user, project, or even specific build target), it's likely to have relevant data already cached. This could include source code, build tools, or intermediate build artifacts. Routing the new task to this "warm" executor can lead to substantial performance gains by improving cache hit rates and reducing the need to download dependencies or recompute intermediate steps. The `TaskRouter` considers this affinity when ranking potential executors for a task.

**CI Runner Routing** is a more specialized form of affinity routing tailored for Continuous Integration (CI) workloads. For CI jobs, factors like the Git repository URL and branch name are strong indicators of the workspace context. BuildBuddy can use this information to route CI tasks to runners that have previously handled jobs for the same repository and branch. This increases the likelihood that the runner already has a synchronized workspace with the correct commit checked out, potentially saving significant time in cloning or updating the repository. This is particularly beneficial for iterative development workflows where CI jobs are triggered frequently on the same branches.

The benefits of these intelligent routing strategies are manifold:
-   **Improved Performance:** Faster task completion times due to better cache utilization and reduced setup overhead.
-   **Better Resource Utilization:** Maximizing the utility of cached data means less network bandwidth and disk I/O consumed for fetching resources.
-   **Faster CI Builds:** Specifically for CI tasks, routing to runners with warm workspaces dramatically speeds up the feedback loop for developers.

The `TaskRouter` plays a crucial role by evaluating these (and other) factors to rank suitable executors, ultimately aiming to place each task on the node that can execute it most efficiently.

## Fine-Tuning Performance: Advanced Scheduling Features

Beyond the core scheduling algorithms, BuildBuddy incorporates several advanced features to further optimize performance and resource utilization. These include mechanisms like queue trimming and nuanced handling of custom resource requirements.

**Queue Trimming:** In dynamic environments, especially those using autoscaling, an executor might be assigned a task that has, unbeknownst to it, already been completed by another executor (perhaps one that scaled up quickly). To prevent redundant work, executors can perform **queue trimming**. The `PriorityTaskScheduler`'s `trimQueue` logic allows an executor to check the status of tasks in its local queue. If it discovers that a task has already been completed or is actively being processed elsewhere, it can safely drop that task from its own queue, freeing up its local capacity sooner. This is particularly useful for avoiding wasted effort when tasks are speculatively assigned or when scaling events lead to transient inconsistencies.

**Custom Resource Scheduling:** Modern workloads often require specialized resources beyond CPU and RAM, such as GPUs, specific hardware accelerators, or even software licenses. BuildBuddy's scheduler is designed to handle tasks with such **custom resource** demands. When the `PriorityTaskScheduler`'s `getNextSchedulableTask` logic evaluates tasks, it considers these custom requirements. Importantly, if a high-priority task is blocked *only* because its specific custom resource is currently unavailable (e.g., all GPUs are in use), the scheduler can be configured to intelligently skip over this task for a limited time. This allows other, lower-priority tasks that *don't* require the scarce custom resource (or require different custom resources that *are* available) to proceed. This prevents a "head-of-line blocking" scenario where a few custom-resource-intensive tasks could stall many other tasks that could otherwise be making progress. This ensures that general-purpose executors remain productive even when specialized resources are contended.

These advanced features demonstrate the level of detail required to build a truly efficient and resilient task scheduling system, capable of adapting to diverse workloads and dynamic operational conditions.

## Conclusion

As we've seen, task scheduling in a large-scale distributed system like BuildBuddy is far from a simple FIFO queue. It involves a sophisticated interplay of various techniques designed to maximize efficiency, ensure fairness, maintain reliability, and provide a responsive experience for users.

From **Priority-Based Grouped Queueing** that ensures equitable resource distribution, to **Resource-Aware Scheduling** and **Dynamic Task Sizing** that optimize executor capacity; from **Task Leasing and Reconnection** that underpins reliability, to **Intelligent Affinity and CI Runner Routing** that speeds up execution by leveraging cache warmth and workspace locality; and finally, to advanced features like **Queue Trimming** and intelligent **Custom Resource Handling** that fine-tune performance in dynamic environments—each mechanism plays a crucial role.

Collectively, these strategies contribute to a distributed build system that is not only powerful and scalable but also resilient in the face of fluctuating workloads and inevitable system perturbations. The goal is always to get builds and tests completed as quickly and reliably as possible, and sophisticated scheduling is a cornerstone of achieving that.
